# Project
This project revolves around sentiment analysis of tweets which are primarily related to racism post-pre covid and during covid. We have tried to compare different ML models with multiple word embedding approach such as BoW and TF-IDF
We have also analysed which ML model performs the best out of all these approaches
We also compared BERT with the models and then predicted the tweet sentiment on about 500k rows of tweets
